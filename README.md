# Build a Personal Blog with a Delightful Developer Experience using Astro

## 👋 Welcome

Welcome to the "Build a Personal Blog with Delightful Developer Experience using Astro" course! 👌

In this course we're going to learn Astro by building a fully functional personal blog which we can actually use as our personal developer portfolio at the end. We're going to learn about:

- routing,
- styling,
- shared layouts,
- Astro Islands,
- assets,
- content collections,
- pagination,
- SEO,
- generating a sitemap,
- generating an RSS feed,
- deploying Astro on Vercel,
- deploying Astro on fly.io,
- dockerizing Astro,
- automatic deployments with GitHub Actions,
- using databases,
- creating custom API Endpoints,
- and even dynamically generating OG images for social sharing!

Whew! That's a lot! I really hope you like this course, and have fun learning 💖

## 🤠 Instructor

My name is Lazar Nikolov and I'm a full stack developer from North Macedonia 🇲🇰, based in Canada 🇨🇦!

My first interaction with programming was back in 2011, while I was still in high school. I was learning HTML and CSS on my own, sometimes during the classes (don't tell my teachers 🤫). Throughout my career I've been developing mobile apps, TV apps, desktop apps, but I've found my sweet spot as a Full-stack Engineer working with the React ecosystem.

I'm a super friendly guy, so if you have any questions, or just want to talk to me, the best place to reach me is on Twitter at [@NikolovLazar](https://twitter.com/NikolovLazar).

## 🎯 Goal

After finishing this course, you'll have both basic and advanced skills to build awesome websites using Astro.

## 🚅 Skills

You are going learn how to architecture our front-end using pages, layouts, and components, which is a skill you can apply in every front-end project in your future.

If you haven't worked with TypeScript before, that's another skill that you'll learn and also apply in other frameworks and technologies.

You'll also learn how SEO, sitemaps and RSS feeds work, how to generate dynamic OG images, and how to use Docker to dockerize websites and deploy them on any cloud platform that supports containers.

These are all generic skills that you can apply in other frameworks aside from Astro.

## 🚧 Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be comfortable working with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and understand basic Web Dev concepts.

Here are some egghead.io courses that can bring you up to speed:

- [Up and Running with TypeScript](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-typescript) by John Lindquist
- [Use Types Effectively in TypeScript](https://egghead.io/courses/use-types-effectively-in-typescript) by Ari Picker

## 💽 Local Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.

Each lesson is its own branch in this repo. To get started, run `npm install` at the root (this installs all of the dependencies) and then `npm run dev` to start the local development server.
